    When you look at a stock market ticker, you see numbers flashing in red and green, constantly shifting. 
    While the market can feel chaotic, price movements are generally driven by a specific set of fundamental 
    and psychological factors. This guide breaks down why those numbers move.

  <h2 id="supply-demand">The Fundamental Law: Supply and Demand</h2>
  <p>
    At its most basic level, the stock market functions like an auction. The price of a stock moves based on the balance between buyers (demand) and sellers (supply). If more people want to buy a stock than sell it, the price goes up. Conversely, if more people are looking to sell than buy, the price falls.
  </p>
  <p>
    This relationship is often represented by the "Bid" and the "Ask." The <strong>Bid</strong> is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay, and the <strong>Ask</strong> is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. When these two meet, a trade occurs, and that transaction becomes the "current price" you see on your screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Supply can also be affected by the company itself. For example, if a company issues new shares (dilution), the supply increases, which can put downward pressure on the price. If a company engages in a "share buyback," it reduces the supply of shares available, which can often drive the price higher.
  </p>
  <p><em>This topic connects with <strong>Stock Market Basics</strong>.</em></p>

  <h2 id="earnings-performance">Company Performance and Earnings Reports</h2>
  <p>
    If supply and demand are the "how" of price movement, company performance is often the "why." Investors buy stocks because they want to own a piece of a profitable business. Therefore, the health of that business is a primary driver of its stock price.
  </p>

  <h3>The Role of Earnings Season</h3>
  <p>
    Public companies are required to release financial reports every quarter. During "earnings season," the market processes these reports to determine if a company is growing, stagnating, or shrinking. Key metrics include:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> The total amount of money the company brought in.</li>
      <li><strong>Net Income (Profit):</strong> What remains after all expenses are paid.</li>
      <li><strong>Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong> The portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share.</li>
  </ul>

    class="article-image"

  <h3>The "Expectations Game"</h3>
  <p>
    Interestingly, a stock price doesn’t just move based on how much money a company made; it moves based on how that money compares to what analysts <em>expected</em>. If a company earns a million dollars but the market expected two million, the stock price may fall. This is because the previous price already "baked in" the higher expectation.
  </p>

  <h2 id="interest-rates">The Influence of Interest Rates and Central Banks</h2>
  <p>
    While company performance matters, the broader environment in which those companies operate is equally important. Perhaps the most powerful external force on stock prices is the movement of interest rates, usually set by a country’s central bank (such as the Federal Reserve).
  </p>
  <p>There is generally an inverse relationship between interest rates and stock prices. When interest rates rise:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Borrowing becomes expensive:</strong> Companies find it costlier to borrow money for expansion, which can lower their future profits.</li>
      <li><strong>Consumer spending drops:</strong> High rates on credit cards and mortgages leave consumers with less disposable income to spend.</li>
      <li><strong>Alternative investments become attractive:</strong> When interest rates are high, "safe" investments like government bonds offer better returns, causing some investors to move money out of the stock market.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="economic-indicators">Macroeconomic Indicators: Inflation and GDP</h2>
  <p>
    The stock market is often seen as a barometer for the overall economy. Several key data points, known as macroeconomic indicators, can cause significant swings in stock prices.
  </p>

  <h3>Inflation</h3>
  <p>
    Inflation is the rate at which the price of goods and services rises. Moderate inflation is generally seen as a sign of a healthy, growing economy. However, hyper-inflation or very rapid price increases can be damaging. It forces the central bank to raise interest rates and increases the cost of raw materials for companies, which can squeeze profit margins.

  <h3>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h3>
  <p>
    GDP represents the total value of everything produced within a country. High GDP growth suggests a booming economy where businesses are likely to see increased sales. If GDP shrinks for two consecutive quarters, the economy is technically in a recession, which usually leads to falling stock prices across most sectors.

  <h2 id="investor-sentiment">Investor Sentiment and Market Psychology</h2>
  <p>
    The stock market is not always rational. Because it is made up of human beings, emotions play a massive role in price movement. This is often referred to as <strong>Investor Sentiment</strong>.
  </p>
  <h3>Fear and Greed</h3>
  <p>
    In the short term, the market is often a "voting machine" for human emotion. When investors are greedy, they may drive prices up far beyond what the company’s fundamentals justify (creating a "bubble"). When investors are afraid, they may sell stocks indiscriminately, causing prices to plummet even if the companies are still healthy.
  </p>

  <h2 id="geopolitics">Geopolitical Events and External Shocks</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes, stock prices move because of events that have nothing to do with finance or business. These are often called "Black Swan" events or external shocks.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Elections:</strong> Changes in government can lead to changes in tax law, regulation, and trade policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Trade Wars:</strong> Tariffs between countries can increase the cost of doing business for international companies.</li>
      <li><strong>Conflict and Instability:</strong> Wars can disrupt global supply chains, leading to uncertainty. The market tends to dislike uncertainty more than almost anything else.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supply and Demand:</strong> The ultimate engine of price movement. More buyers than sellers equals a higher price.</li>
    <li><strong>Expectations:</strong> It is not just about profit; it is about whether a company performed better or worse than analysts expected.</li>
    <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Central bank decisions on interest rates are perhaps the single most important factor for broad market trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> Human emotions like fear and greed can cause prices to deviate from their actual value in the short term.</li>
  </ul>
